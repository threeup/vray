## Rules

### High Priority (must always be followed)

1. read build instructions from readme.md
2. when coding, use well formed names
3. when coding, do not bloat a function
4. modify tasks.md when something is accomplished on the list
5. make a new task in tasks.md and mark it completed when it is significant

### Low Priority (apply if possible, but secondary)

- pull stuff into constants where possible
- use good design patterns
- fix up architecture.md as you go
